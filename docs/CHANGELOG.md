# FLUX Changelog

Plain-English log of every completed task, newest first. Each loop iteration
adds one entry (see `AGENT_LOOP.md`).

## Phase 1 — Multi-pass FBO pipeline

Refactored the `Renderer` from a single direct-to-screen draw into a multi-pass
pipeline, the foundation for every post-effect that follows (dither, bloom,
feedback, etc.):

- **New `Framebuffer` helper** (`src/render/Framebuffer.ts`) — allocates RGBA8
  off-screen render targets (LINEAR/CLAMP, no depth), with resize + delete.
- **Mode → off-screen `scene` FBO.** The active mode no longer draws straight to
  the screen; it renders into a texture.
- **Ordered, toggleable post-pass chain** across a **ping-pong** pair
  (`ping`/`pong`), so each pass samples the previous stage as `uSource`. The
  final texture is blitted to the screen (`gl.blitFramebuffer`). With an empty
  chain the mode's texture is presented unchanged — the 3 existing modes look
  identical to before.
- **Feedback support.** A `history` FBO keeps last frame's final output, bound
  as `uPrevFrame`, so trail/feedback passes can sample the previous frame.
- **New `PostPass` seam + pass registry** on `Renderer` (`registerPass`,
  `setPassEnabled`, `passNames`), mirroring the existing mode registry. Passes
  share the mode header (builtins + control uniforms + `common.glsl`) plus the
  two sampler uniforms.

Verified: `npm run build` clean, 12/12 tests pass, Preview shows plasma
rendering identically through the new path, error overlay empty
(`#errors.childElementCount === 0`), WebGL context alive, no console errors.

This is plumbing, not an aesthetic change, so no reference shader was adapted;
the ping-pong + blit-to-screen pattern is the standard WebGL2 post-processing
approach.

## Loop protocol — continuous multi-task build

Adjusted the autonomous loop from one-task-per-iteration to **continuous
building**: each run works through tasks back-to-back, with one atomic commit
per task, and stops at the **end of Phase 1** for review (or when blocked /
context grows heavy). Per-task commits + per-task verification are preserved, so
a long unattended run stays fully reviewable and reversible. Designed to run on
an interval `/loop` so context auto-resets between runs.

---

## Phase 0 — Loop infrastructure

Set up everything an autonomous loop needs to keep building FLUX safely:

- **Git** initialized; baseline commit captures Sprints 0–1 (foundation +
  mic-only input picker). `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules/` and `dist/`.
- **`README.md`** — what FLUX is, how to run it, the module map, conventions.
- **`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — the machine-readable task list and source of truth.
  Front-loads the shader & sound-visualization work; backlog holds beat
  detection, presets, logo upload, MIDI, performance output, and a gated deploy
  track.
- **`docs/AGENT_LOOP.md`** — the per-iteration protocol: pick the first unchecked
  task, research first, implement, verify (build + tests + Preview screenshot +
  no console errors), commit, log, tick. One task per iteration; never push;
  never commit a red build.
- **`docs/CHANGELOG.md`** — this file.
- **vitest** harness with unit tests for the pure-logic audio modules
  (`bands.ts`, `EnvelopeFollower.ts`); `npm test` added.

## History to date (pre-loop)

- **Sprint 1 — Input picker.** Mic device dropdown via `enumerateDevices`,
  permission-before-enumerate, dedup of `default`/`communications` aliases,
  live `devicechange` refresh. Briefly trialled BlackHole system-loopback, then
  removed it: it needs a per-machine virtual audio device (can't be click-and-go
  for a hosted product) and interfered with other audio apps. FLUX is now
  **mic-only**. Test tone and file upload were also removed to keep the input
  model to live sound only.
- **Sprint 0 — Foundation.** Vite + TS scaffold; AudioEngine with an asymmetric
  fast-attack/slow-release envelope follower for musical motion; WebGL2
  single-pass renderer with a fullscreen triangle; 3 shader modes
  (bars/pulse/plasma); schema-driven control panel; live meters; on-screen error
  overlay; always-on render loop (no play/pause); dockable transparent panel.
